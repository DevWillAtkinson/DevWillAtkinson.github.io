                <h2>Art</h2>
                <p>I'm still practicing my traditional art skills, but for now I have a few computer based art projects displaying various programming skills and concepts.</p>
                <div class="col">
                    <img src="images/DiagonalFractal.png">
                    <img src="images/SquareFractal.png">
                </div>
                <p>The above artworks were produced by a program I wrote to render L-systems.  L-Systems are a technology used to model plant growth and to create recursive, self-similar structures.</p>
                <p>Learn how they work at the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/DevWillAtkinson/RustLSystem">GitHub Repo!</a></p>

                <h2>Writing</h2> 
                <p>I don't have a lot of writing of my own yet.  Here is a list of some of my favorite books, in no particular order:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><u>The Time Machine</u> - H.G. Wells</li>
                    <li><u>Little Brother</u> - Cory Doctorow</li>
                    <li><u>Hatchet</u> - Gary Paulsen</li>
                    <li><u>Walden</u> - Henry David Thoreau</li>
                    <li><u>The Catcher in the Rye</u> - J. D. Stalinger</li>
                </ul>

            <section id="gameDev">
                <h2>Game Development</h2>
                <p>I used to be deeper into game development, but then I began to feel the technologies of the space were bloated.  Many of my projects have been framework based as I tended to avoid large engines due to the overhead and lack of need for the features they provide.</p>
                <p>Now I am more interested in de-bloating software and making small games with simple graphics frameworks that set up a simple way to send images to screens.  Even now, I feel that sending images to screens can be more work than necessary.  </p>
                <p>When you're done setting up a device context, you're often a hundred or so lines of code in.  I'm hoping there can be a better way and am currently researching alternative graphics technologies.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="programming">
                <h2>Computer Science and Programming Concepts</h2>
                <p>I am currently learning new languages to see what I like best.  Currently, Rust is my favorite.  It's developer-friendly features and easy-to-use dependency manager make it a very easy language to pick up and develop for.</p>
